1. The code references to quizzes file , make sure you have quizzes folder in C drive. ( C:\quizzes)
   If you have extracted quizzes to some other location than you have to change the location in the code class CreateDOM.java accordingly
   
2. I have used MySQL database , if you don`t have MySQL or working with some other database make sure you change it accordingly
